					<p>My name is Maddie, I am 25 years old and the face behind In Movement Training! üëãüèº</p><br>
					<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had a deep passion for health and fitness. I have spent the past 12 months juggling lockdowns, full time employment, my own training and being a mum to my beautiful four year old son, all while studying - gaining my Level 4 in Personal training & Fitness Leadership, I am currently working through my Level 5 Advanced PT papers and ticking off a number of specialised certificates that I cannot wait to share in more depth with you!</p><br>
					<p>My love for movement runs well and truely in my blood. With over 10 years experience on the hockey field, and having submerged myself in various other exercise including HIIT training, Muay Thai, half marathons, bootcamps, boxing, most recently spending the last 8 years developing a strong understanding around resistance and strength training. Pairing all of this with my love for helping others and we have a bloody good recipe for some kick ass training!!!</p><br>
					<p>I cannot wait to get to know you all better, share everything I have learnt and hopefully work alongside some of you to create, challenge, motivate and inspire!</p>
