				<p style="max-width: 600px" align="left" class="side-p">Pregnancy training is a form of exercise specifically designed for women who are pregnant. The goal of pregnancy training is to help women maintain their physical fitness and overall health during pregnancy, while also preparing the body for labor and delivery. Pregnancy training can include a variety of exercises such as cardio, strength training, and stretching. The benefits of pregnancy training include reducing the risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia, it also helps to improve posture and reduce back pain, and can also improve sleep quality. Pregnancy training can also aid in a faster recovery postpartum. It is always important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any exercise program during pregnancy.</p><br>
